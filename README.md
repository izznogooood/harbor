# ‚öì Harbor: Self-Hosted Docker Management Dashboard

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## üåä Overview

Harbor is a **self-hosted, intuitive dashboard** designed to simplify the management of your Docker services. Forget the command line for routine tasks ‚Äì Harbor provides a clean web interface to control your containers, pull images, view logs, and automate updates, all from your own infrastructure.

Built for self-hosting enthusiasts, system administrators, and small/medium business IT teams, Harbor gives you full control and ownership over your Docker environment.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Service Management:** Create, edit, delete, start, stop, and restart your Docker services with ease.
*   **Comprehensive Service Definitions:** Define services with full control over `image`, `container_name`, `environment` variables, `volumes`, `ports`, `restart` policies, and `depends_on` relationships ‚Äì just like a `docker-compose.yml`.
*   **Real-time Status & Logs:** Monitor service health and fetch the latest logs directly from the dashboard.
*   **Image Management:** Manually pull Docker images to keep your services up-to-date.
*   **Automated Scheduling:** Configure daily or weekly schedules for automatic image pulls and service restarts.
*   **Secure & Self-Contained:** All components are self-hosted, ensuring data ownership and secure communication via local Unix sockets.
*   **Audit Logging:** Track all significant actions for audit and troubleshooting purposes.

## üöÄ Getting Started
